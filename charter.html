				<h2>Scope</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Continue development of existing ARIA specifications to address needs reported by authors of accessible content and to achieve parity with native host languages (markup languages such as HTML or SVG that can use ARIA attributes to provide additional accessibility information), creating new ARIA specifications where necessary;</li>
					<li>For each ARIA specification developed by this Working Group, create a corresponding Accessibility API Mappings specification defining the correct exposure for each platform;</li>
					<li>For all attributes defined by this Working Group, document best practices for authors;</li>
					<li>Collaborate with other groups to create mapping specifications for native host language semantics, generally but not always to be published by the ARIA WG;</li>
					<li>Work with developers of testing tools that can be used to verify accessibility implementations by examining the mappings exposed via platform accessibility APIs;</li>
					<li>Collaborate with other groups involved in defining ARIA techniques and implementing ARIA support.</li>
				</ul>
				<section id="section-out-of-scope">
					<h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
					<p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working Group:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Technologies for which corresponding Accessibility API Mappings do not need to be defined.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section id="deliverables">
				<h2> Deliverables </h2>
				<p>In order to maximize the likelihood of achieving the success criteria described below, the ARIA Working Group will follow a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/workflow">work flow</a> designed to see each feature from its <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/roadmap">road map</a> through to completion, with ARIA feature development, platform accessibility API mapping, implementation, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/testing-how-to/#test-as-you-commit-pointer-event-whatwg-webperf">testing</a>, and authoring guidance taking place at the same time.</p>
				<p>More detailed milestones and updated publication schedules are available on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/project">group publication status page</a>.</p>
				<p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. <i>Expected completion</i> indicates when the deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable state. For deliverables marked as “living standard”, the Working Group intends to publish the latest state of their work as Candidate Recommendation (with Snapshots). The Working Group will publish Recommendations approximately every two years for specifications that define technology features. The Working Group will not publish Recommendation versions of Accessibility API Mappings because they define mappings to accessibility APIs, which may be updated independent of the ARIA technology.</p>
				<section id="normative">
					<h3> Normative Specifications </h3>
					<p> The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications: </p>

					<h3> Other Deliverables </h3>
					<p>As described above and in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/workflow">work flow</a>, the Working Group will create a test suite and implementation report for the specification. In addition, other non-normative documents may be created such as use case and requirement documents.</p>
					<p>The Working Group also expects to collaborate with other groups which produce ARIA and/or Accessibility API Mappings specifications to ensure that all ARIA modules and Accessibility API Mappings specifications are consistent with one another regardless of the producer.</p>
					<p> The Working Group will also produce WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, a comprehensive support resource for the WAI-ARIA suite but not published as a Technical Report itself. In further support of that guidance, the Working Group will work with developers of the <a href="https://aria-at.w3.org/">ARIA-AT application</a> to help achieve consistent implementation of the guidance across tools.</p>
					<p>Other non-normative documents may be created such as: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use case and requirement documents;</li>
						<li>Test suite and implementation report for the specification;</li>
						<li>Primer or Best Practice documents to support web developers when designing applications.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="timeline">
					<h3>Timeline</h3>
					<p>The Working Group maintains a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/project">detailed project plan</a> that provides target dates, updated as needed.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section id="success-criteria">
				<h2>Success Criteria</h2>
				<p>The normative documents produced by this Working Group fall into two categories: ARIA specifications and Accessibility API Mapping specifications.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For the ARIA specifications, implementability and interoperability of every feature will be demonstrated by having at least two independent browser implementations of that feature. In addition, for the Accessibility API Mapping specification(s), each ARIA feature will be shown to have at least one implementation in each of: ATK/AT-SPI2, MSAA+IAccessible2, AXAPI, and UIAutomation.</li>
					<li>Every effort will be made to take member organizations' schedules into account and to ensure all platforms are included. If needed, an Accessibility API Mapping specification will be split into platform-specific specifications, e.g. one for ATK/AT-SPI2, one for MSAA+IAccessible2, one for AXAPI, and one for UIAutomation. This will allow each platform's specification to progress along the Rec track at the timeline that best suits them. For specifications which are not split apart in this fashion, no platform will be dropped out of the specification without prior consultation with that platform's owners.</li>
				</ul>
				<p> Modules that reach <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Process-20200915/#rec-publication">W3C Recommendation</a> are considered successful when all of the following are present:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Production of stable documents addressing the work items listed in the Deliverables section.</li>
					<li>Test suites for each module with conformance criteria.</li>
					<li>Availability of multiple, independent, interoperable implementations of each feature with conformance criteria in each deliverable; as demonstrated by an implementation report (summarizing implementation status against the relevant test suite) for each testable class of product, including user agents.</li>
					<li>Deployment on multiple platforms.</li>
					<li>User community and industry adoption of the group deliverables.</li>
				</ul>
				<p> In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
				<p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
				<p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
				<p> To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="coordination">
				<h2>Coordination</h2>
				<p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes
					occur in a specification following a review.</p>
				<p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>
